# AdventureWorks sample queries
> **A complilation of queries I've used as practice
for learning T-SQL and SSMS**

## What you need

> In order to run these queries you'll need to download the 
AdventureWorks2019.bak sample database and restore it to your SQL server instance.
The download page including instructions is found here:
[AdventureWorks] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms)

>  Once you have the database on your SQL server, you should be able to run any of the queries.
There is one caveat: Most of my queries will include "use AdventureWorks2019" as a first line. You'll
need to be sure that either that is what you name the database when you restore it locally, or 
you'll need to change the name in the code to match.
